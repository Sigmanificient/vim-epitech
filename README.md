## Thanks

This project started as a clone of 
[HelifeWasTAken/vim-epitech](https://github.com/HelifeWasTaken/vim-epitech), 
which is more of a vim distro, a ready to go vim config than an actual plugin.
So this was not the best for student with already a Vim config, and some of the
settings are deprecated (i.e. `syntax on` is hardcoded in the config, but this
settings is forbidden in some Epitech, like Bordeaux, during the C Pool).

This is the current goal of this project: turning the old config into a plugin
that students can install on both Neovim and Vim with a plugin manager like
Vim-plug or LazyNvim.
